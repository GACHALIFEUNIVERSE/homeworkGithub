#Q2 " HOW TO EXECUTE  if.py in the terminal ?"
#python if.py

# Q3 write the code using ( == != < > <= >= )
#print(9==9) => true
#print(9!=9) => false
#print(2<10) => true
#print(2>10) => false > ( greater than )
#print(5<=10)=> true
#print(9>=11)=> false
# See the code below and answer by commenting this has THREE question to answer. Q4 , Q5 , Q6 , Q7

#Eg.  QX. User input int 45 which letter the program return ? 
#F

# if score >= 90:
 #       letter = 'A'

  #  elif score >= 80:
   #     letter = 'B'
    #elif score >= 70:
     #   letter = 'C'
    #elif score >= 60:
     #   letter = 'D'
    #else:
     #   letter = 'F'

#Q4 User input int 45 which letter the program return ?
=> F
#Q5 User input int 80 which letter the program return ?
=> b
#Q6 User input int 75 which letter the program return ?
=> f
#Q7 User input int 1 which letter the program return ?
